### COVID-19 Medical PPE Sewing Project

In response to the urgent need for medical PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic, I am assembling a team of seamstresses (including myself) to volunteer their time and skills to sew medical PPE such as masks and gowns to be donated to local hospitals. As part of an industrial design project for school, I am also designing a mask sewing pattern and instruction/materials kit to be used in this effort (packets with materials, patterns, and sewing instructions with be made available to seamstresses contributing to the project). The mask pattern was created by merging and modifying several CDC-approved mask patterns found online with pattern alterations and additions resulting from prototype testing and production process simplifications.
